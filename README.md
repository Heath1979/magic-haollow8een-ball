## Design  

### **Color Scheme**  

The website uses a pallette of pastels in line with the brief that the site should have a caliming effect. The corn silk was intended to be the main background focus initially as outlined in the wireframe but worked better visibily as a background for the header and the footer and contrasted nicely with the background image in the main content section.
